# "Projects", as defined in https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/using/namespaces#projects
#
# Each project is a distinct namespace within the deployment, with access to its own resources.
# In particular, each project has its own workers.  A project also has a set of administrators
# defined by user roles.
#
# Each entry in this file is defined as follows:
#
# <project-name>:
#   admin-roles:
#     # roles with administrative access to the project's resources
#     - role1
#     - ..
#   worker-pools:
#     <worker-pool-name>:
#       owner: ..
#       emailOnError: ..
#       type: <name of a function in `generate/workers.py`)
#       ..: ..  # arguments to that function
#   grants:  # (same format as grants.yml)
#
# The worker-pool configurations are defined by Python functions, keyed by the `type` property.
# See that file for the available options.  The defaults are usually fine.
